# Creating Snippets

Everyone knows that self-learning is crucial for success as a developer.  But how do you self-learn self-learning without already having learned how to self-learn?

Learning to create small and simple snippets of code that clearly illustrate a single principle (and only one single principle) is challenging but worth the effort.  This skill will help you:
* Create your JS reference
* Study new code
* Write the cleanest code possible
* Write maintainable code
* Debug & refactor existing code
* ... and everything else that is good

So read on, it'll pay off.  Being able to think of each chunk of code you ever write as a self-explanatory text will make you every developers' best friend.

## Specifications

Identify the skill or concept you want to practice, then gradually develop the clearest snippet you can to communicate this principle. Don't be afraid to develop your snippets with a particular study tool in mind! PythonTutor, flow chart generators, ChromeDev, ...

Creating the best snippets is an iterative and collaborative process.  So start with something, find a partner, and design these snippets together:
1. Identify a concept or skill you sort of understand, but would like to master.
2. Construct (or find) a simple example that isolates this skill or concept.
3. Break down the snippet:
  * Is there anything you're not familiar with that isn't your target concept?
  * Do the variables names help understand the code?
  * Are there any _logs_ or _asserts_ that might help?
  * Avoid Comments, let the code's behavior speak for itself. 
  * Does it fit well with the chosen study environment?
4. Revise the snippet according to your answers to the questions in 3.
5. Ask someone else for feedback on your snippet. And listen to their feedback!
6. Return to step 3.
